# Similarify 

## Goal
Using the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/) and [Spotipy library](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.24.0/), this project contains a series of Python scripts to obtain, clean, and analyze Spotify playlist data. The goal of this project is to utilize clustering algorithms and feature extraction to identify similaries between songs in existing playlists. All songs across playlists will be restructured based on their similarity scores.
